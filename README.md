# Everyday Moral Transgressions

This repository contains the data for Elmore, Lewis, Himmelberger, & Sherwood (in press). The directory includes the following:

1. A [Quarto notebook](/published-analyses.nb.html) that contains the analyses published in the paper.
2. A [directory](/public-data/) containing de-indentified datasets.
3. A directory containing R scripts used to process the data. These scripts **will not run**, as some participants were excluded (by request; see the manuscript for more detail). Thus, we filter the data as part of the data processing and made public only the post-processed data.
